# Project: Bias Mitigation in Machine Learning

This project aims to address bias in machine learning models by implementing and evaluating different bias mitigation strategies.

## Project Structure

This project includes notebooks that demonstrate the process of:

1. **Baseline Model Training:** Train a machine learning model on a chosen dataset.
2. **Bias Assessment:** Assess the trained model's fairness using different metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds.
3. **Bias Mitigation:** Implement bias mitigation strategies (pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing).
4. **Post-Mitigation Evaluation:** Assess the model's fairness and performance after implementing mitigation techniques.
5. **Comparison and Conclusions:** Compare baseline and post-mitigation results to analyze the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.



## Overall Conclusions

* **Performance Trade-offs**: All mitigation strategies led to some reduction in overall model performance, especially in terms of accuracy and F1-score. However, they contributed to improvements in fairness metrics, with varying degrees of success.
* **EqOddsPostprocessing**: This strategy resulted in the least decrease in performance, maintaining an accuracy of 0.87 and modest improvements in fairness. It reduced demographic parity from 0.109 to 0.069 and brought equalized odds close to 0.0 for group 0, indicating a strong improvement in fairness with a minimal loss in performance.
* **Adversarial Debiasing**: This strategy led to a moderate decline in performance (accuracy decreased from 0.88 to 0.76), but it improved fairness significantly. It reduced demographic parity from 0.222 to 0.163 and improved equalized odds, especially for group 1.
* **CalibratedClassifierCV**: This strategy resulted in the most significant performance drop (accuracy decreased from 0.88 to 0.56), but it eliminated demographic parity completely, achieving a score of 0.0. Equalized odds improved marginally for both groups, but this came at a notable cost to overall model performance.

**Mitigation Strategy with Most Improvement**: **EqOddsPostprocessing** resulted in the most balanced improvement, maintaining decent performance while achieving strong fairness metrics.

**Mitigation Strategy with Least Improvement**: **CalibratedClassifierCV** resulted in the least improvement, as it led to a substantial performance drop despite eliminating bias and improving fairness slightly.
